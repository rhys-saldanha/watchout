# Watch Out!
Here you can find the first real program I ever made (2013).
In order to practice programming and Python, I challenged myself to make a game and somewhat succeeded.

Running this code requires pygame and therefore python2.7 (sorry).
Since this is before I discovered git, there's a changelog [here](../master/WatchOut/Changelog.txt)
